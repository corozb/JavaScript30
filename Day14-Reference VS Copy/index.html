    // now here is the problem!
    // When you update an array that go back to its reference and update the original array
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way

    console.log(team2, players2)

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players2)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players2]
    team4[3] = 'ole ole olee'

    console.log(team4)

    const team5 = Array.from(players2) //other way
    team5[3] = 'Parce'
    console.log(team5)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    console.log(players2)


    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person
    // captain.number = 99
    console.log(person)

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 35 })
    console.log(cap2)
    console.log(person)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person} // In object same with an Array const team4 = [...players2]


    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
