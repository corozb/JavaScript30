# JavaScript30

In this repository I built **30 things** in **30 days** with **30 tutorials**. This help me to learn and improve my skills in Javascript.

This was thanks to tthe web https://wesbos.com/. Go ahead and build your owm projects too.

## [Day 1 - Javascript Drum Kit](https://github.com/corozb/JavaScript30/tree/master/Day1-drum-kit)
This project it's about a keyboard drum, just type a key and the web reproduce a sound associated. 
To identify each KeyCode we can use http://keycode.info/ and shows:
- event.key
- event.which
- event.code

For example the KeyCode for **d** is **68**. And later this key correspond with a sound file associated.

This it´s how look the web finally:<br />

D|...|A|.....|D|A|
```

**Also you can learn a lot in the web: https://learningmusic.ableton.com/make-beats/make-beats.html**

We gonna manipulate an array. With the idea to: <br />
<br />
  **1. Array.prototype.filter()** <br/> Filter the list of inventors for those who were born in the 1500's <br/>
  **2. Array.prototype.map()** <br/> Give us an array of the inventors' first and last names <br/>
  **3.  Array.prototype.sort()** <br/> Sort the inventors by birthdate, oldest to youngest <br/>
  **4.  Array.prototype.reduce()** <br/> How many years did all the inventors live? <br/>
   5. Sort the inventors by years lived <br/>
   6. create a list of Boulevards in Paris that contain 'de' anywhere in the name <br/>
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Boulevards_in_Paris  <br/>
   **7. sort Exercise**  <br/>
    Sort the people alphabetically by last name  <br/>
   **8. Reduce Exercise**  <br/>
    Sum up the instances of each element in an Array
    
 ## [Day 5 - Flex Panel Galery](https://github.com/corozb/JavaScript30/tree/master/Day5-Flex_Panel_Gallery)
This project it´s about build an interactive gallery where with can change the image and see the message that contain.
We practice animations and flexbox. 

This it's another resources to learn:
- [Flexbox](https://flexbox.io/)
- [CSS Grid](https://cssgrid.io/)
- Also [Markdown](https://masteringmarkdown.com)

We can show the images animations in two ways:
- Clicking de Image (with functions)
- Just putting the pointer over (with hover)

This was the result:

    ° Find the comment with this ID <br/>
    ° delete the comment with the ID of 823423
