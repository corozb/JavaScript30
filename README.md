## [Day 1 - Javascript Drum Kit](https://github.com/corozb/JavaScript30/tree/master/Day1-drum-kit)
This project it's about a keyboard drum, just type a key and the web reproduce a sound associated. 
To identify each KeyCode we can use http://keycode.info/ and shows:
- event.key
- event.which
- event.code

For example the KeyCode for **d** is **68**. And later this key correspond with a sound file associated.
